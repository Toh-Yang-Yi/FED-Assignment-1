# FED-Assignment-1
This is my FED assignment project.
Project's name : 
Jung Kook's website

Overview :
This is a project on creating a website for a song artist - Jung Kook. This website aims to promote Jung Kook's music and also allow the fans to connect and learn more about Jung Kook. This website allows fans to book tickets to his concerts and to also listen to his released songs. Fans can also support Jung Kook buy purchasing his merch via the website.

Design Process :
- Since this website design is specifically for Jung Kook and his fans, I thought that using the color black accompanied with white would be appropriate because Jung Kooks favourite color is black.
- As a user myself, I would want the website to be convenient when locating the different sections the website has. So, I decided to use a top menu so that the menu is easily accessible and convenient.
- As a suer myself, I also want to be able to show support to Jung Kook by purchasing his concert tickets and merch which is why at the homepage, I decided to showcase his merch and also included his concert tickets at the top menu
