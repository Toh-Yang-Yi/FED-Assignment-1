# FED-Assignment-1
This is my FED assignment project.
Project's name : 
Jung Kook's website

Overview :

This is a project on creating a website for a song artist - Jung Kook. This website aims to promote Jung Kook's music and also allow the fans to connect and learn more about Jung Kook. This website allows fans to view Concert details and to also listen to his released songs. Fans can also support Jung Kook buy purchasing his merch via the website.

Design Process :

- Since this website design is specifically for Jung Kook and his fans, I thought that using the color black accompanied with white would be appropriate because Jung Kooks favourite color is black.

- As a user myself, I would want the website to be convenient when locating the different sections the website has. So, I decided to use a top menu so that the menu is easily accessible and convenient.

- As a user myself, I also want to be able to check when Jung kook is having a concert and also where the concert is being held at which is why at the Concert Page, I decided to showcase his concert details when a user searches for the location

- As a user myself, I also want to be able to buy Jung kook merch and show him support. So, I added a add to cart function and display some jung kook merchandises on the merch page

Features :

Top navigation bar - Universal navigation tool which allow the user to navigate to every page conveniently. The position is fixed so that the user doesn't have to keep scrolling back up

drop down menu - the hamburger bar will appear when the screen size is reduced to a certain width and will replace the top navigation bar for responsiveness

Music Page:
thumnail - The thumbnail of the songs will slowly fade in from the left or the right 

neon-button - the buttono will change in color and also become brighter when hovering over it. users can also click on the button to play the song.

Merch Page:
products - the products container include the image, type of product, description and add to cart. Users are able to click on add to cart to add the item to their cart.

shopping cart icon - Users can click on the shopping cart icon to reveal their cart and check how much item they have and the total cost. Thye can also remove the items for the cart.

Concert Page:
Search bar - when hovering over the search bar, the search icon will slide to the write and allow users to type their text. 

Future Plans:
I could implement a javascript for the search bar in concert page to filter out the events that are selected by the user based on the closest location to what they searched.

I could implement a javascript and a search bar to the music page to filter songs absed on solo songs, order of date released of most popular.
